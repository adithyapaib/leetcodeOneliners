## 1528. Shuffle String
You are given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.

Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
Output: "abc"
Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.



## Python

```python
class Solution:
    def restoreString(self, s: str, indices: List[int]) -> str:
         return ''.join(char for _, char in sorted(zip(indices, s)))

```
